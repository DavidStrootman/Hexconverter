# decimal - hexadecimal
hexadecimal <> decimal conversion 

### In development
partially working with switch for single digit conversion.
input / 16

if the result is larger than 16, get the decimals and multiply by 16.
if the result is still larger than 16, repeat the division by 16 until the result is smaller than 16.
 convert all remainders and endresult to hexadecimals.
 Add these values from right to left in order to get the hexadecimal version of the input value.
